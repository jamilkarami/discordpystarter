# Discord.py Starter Bot
Barebones Discord bot that does nothing. I wrote it just to skip doing this every time I'm writing a new bot.

It uses [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py). Refer to the [documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to further add/develop to this bot.

It also implements cogs which are a way to organize/separate code into different files for Discord.py bots.

## Usage

Clone this repo, then use the following command to get all the packages you need:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the bot, use:

```
python .\bot.py
```
